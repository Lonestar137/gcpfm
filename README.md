# GCPFM

## Description  

The problem:  
Using the web console for GCP is slow, tedious, and repetitive when often you just want to find a file really quick without the hassle of navigating through 10 sub directories.  


The solution:  
GCPFM attempts to speed up navigating buckets in GCP by providing a fast and intuitive TUI.  Users can quickly open a GCP bucket and start browsing the bucket using the built-in fuzzy finder.  GCPFM handles background updates so you don't have to wait for GCP to update the bucket taxonomy when you or someone makes a change.


## Installation  

Coming soon!
